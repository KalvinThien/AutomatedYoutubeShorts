00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,950
A letter from October 5, 2022. Dear future me,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,930
wherever you are and whatever you are doing, stop right now and just breathe.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,486
Take a moment to take it all in and allow yourself a moment just for

4
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:14,622
you. Allow yourself a moment of rest, a moment

5
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:18,126
of quiet, a moment to do something just for you. You have

6
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:21,694
been working so hard these past few months, and it's okay to slow down or

7
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:25,030
even stop altogether and just rest. You deserve it.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,534
It you deserve time to reset and take care of you. Whatever time

9
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:32,198
you carve out for yourself is not selfish. It is a must. So you can

10
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:36,482
be a better mom, a better caregiver, a better friend, a better confidant,

11
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:40,214
a better version of you. I hope you have an amazing day. And please

12
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:43,830
know that I am proud of all of your efforts. All of the long hours

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,526
and sacrifices to reach your goals and improve your life have all been

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,694
worth it. Just don't forget to enjoy the present moment while you're working so

15
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:52,810
hard to achieve your dream.
