Wherever you are and whatever you are doing, stop right now and just breathe. Take a moment to take it all in and allow yourself a moment just for you. Allow yourself a moment of rest, a moment of quiet, a moment to do something just for YOU. You have been working so hard these past few months and it's ok to slow down or even stop all together and just rest. You deserve it. You deserve time to reset and take care of YOU. Whatever time you carve out for yourself is not selfish. It is a MUST so you can be a better Mom, a better caregiver, a better friend, a better confidant, a better version of you. 

I hope you have an amazing day and please know that I am proud of all of your efforts. All of the long hours and sacrifices to reach your goals and improve your life, have all been worth it! Just don't forget to enjoy the present moment while you're working so hard to achieve your dream."
